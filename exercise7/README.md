## Cloud Architecture Question (50%)

You are a system architect at a German company that wants to build applications on a hybrid (public-private) cloud architecture.

You are given the following information:

a) User data must be stored securely on an on-premise private cloud due to regulatory industry requirements. Other data can be stored on a public cloud, but must also be secured appropriately to prevent unauthorized access. The connection between private and public cloud must be secured as well.

b) Applications are web applications built with JavaScript/NodeJS and need a relational database as well as a scalable key-value database to store application data. User data is stored in a relational database.

c) Applications need to exchange data with one another, preferably through a messaging system.

d) Some applications have high scalability and high availability requirements.

e) Performance of the applications should be comparable to state-of-the-art web applications (i.e., ideally subsecond latency).

Given this information, please provide a solution architecture and a technology recommendation for designing and building the system architecture.

Please describe your solution using text (and optionally architecture sketches / diagrams). Submit as txt or PDF file.
