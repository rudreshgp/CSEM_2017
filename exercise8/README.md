# Exercise 8

Submission deadline: 24.01.2018, end of day

Build a serverless web-shop service, similar to our previous exercises 4 and 5.

Your solution must offer 2 CRUD REST APIs for shops and products (similar to the Owner API in exercise 4). The data needs to be stored persistently using a database service (DynamoDB).

Out of scope:

- You do not need to implement an API for managing shop owners.
- You do not need to build a front-end.

Use the following technologies and cloud services:

- JavaScript/NodeJS
- AWS Lambda
- AWS DynamoDB
- Optionally: serverless framework (serverless.com)

You can use the following code as a reference to get started https://github.com/markusklems/programming-aws-lambda/tree/master/javascript

Alternatively, you can build your solution based on other code examples or reference implementations, such as https://github.com/serverless/examples
