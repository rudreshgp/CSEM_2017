# Exercise 9

Submission deadline: 14.02.2018, end of day (before our last exercise session)

The German company from exercise 7 is a financial services company which exclusively serves German customers. You are tasked to review your solution architecture and technology recommendations in regard of compliance with (German) financial services and EU data protection regulations, in particular GDPR compliance.

Conduct research to assess if your solution architecture is compliant. If not, how would the architecture need to be changed? Which processes would you need to set up in order to achieve compliance and how could you implement these processes?

You can focus on a selection of regulatory aspects (e.g., specific financial services regulations for handling transaction data and/or selected GDPR requirements for handling user data). It is NOT expected that you review and assess ALL possible regulatory compliance requirements that exist.

Please write a 2-3 page short paper and submit it as txt or PDF.
